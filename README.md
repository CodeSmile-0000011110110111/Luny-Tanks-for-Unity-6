# Luny Tanks! for Unity 6 (Remastered)

Unity's Tanks! project ported to [Luny](https://lunyscript.com). Luny empowers Unity with Lua scripting. In this port all C# scripts have been ported to [Lua scripts](https://github.com/CodeSmile-0000011110110111/Luny-Tanks-for-Unity-6/tree/main/Assets/_Tanks/Scripts/Lua).

**CAVEAT:** This project is NOT playable/buildable because Luny itself is not included. Luny is (will be) [available separately](https://lunyscript.com). However, Luny can be imported into this project to make it playable/buildable.
